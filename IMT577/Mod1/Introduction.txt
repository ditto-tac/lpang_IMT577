Hi,

I currently live in Silver Spring, MD with my partner and two dogs (Mango and Taro). I currently work as a Business Systems Analyst at Block Inc. but have extensive experience in financial analysis (regulation, credit-risk modeling, and business intelligence). I look forward to learning more about Snowflake, Tableau, and other data management systems as these are very popular in my current industry. 

Something people don't know about me is I like reading Webtoons. According to my end of year statistics, I read over 5,000 chapters (spread across over 100 series) in 2021.
